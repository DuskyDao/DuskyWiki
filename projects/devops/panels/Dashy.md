> For full iconography documentation, see: [**Icons**](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/docs/icons.md)

Both sections and items can have an icon associated with them, defined under the `icon` attribute. With several different icon packs supported, you'll be able to find the perfect thumbnail for any app or service.

The following icon types are supported:

- **Favicon** - Automatically fetch an apps icon from its Favicon or logo image
- **Icon Packs** - Use any icon from [font-awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons), [simple-icons](https://simpleicons.org/) or [material icons](https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign)
- **Emoji** - Any valid emoji can be used as an icon
- **Generative** - Unique, auto-generated images for easily identifying services
- **URL** - Pass the URL of any valid image in to have it fetched and rendered
- **Local** - Store custom images locally and reference by filename
- **Homelab Icons** - Using [dashboard-icons](https://github.com/WalkxCode/dashboard-icons) for logos of commonly self-hosted services

## Status Indicators üö¶

[](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#status-indicators-)

> For full monitoring documentation, see: [**Status Indicators**](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/docs/status-indicators.md)

Dashy has an optional feature to check if each app/ service is up and responding, then display a small status indicator icon. Hovering over it will show additional stats like response time and status code.

Status indicators can be globally enabled by setting `appConfig.statusCheck: true` or enabled/ disabled on a per-item basis. Status is checked on page load, but you can allow continuous polling by specifying a time interval between checks, in seconds under `appConfig.statusCheckInterval`. You can also use a different endpoint for status checking, with `statusCheckUrl`, and if needed, pass in custom headers under `statusCheckHeaders`.

[![Status Checks demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lissy93/dashy/master/docs/assets/status-check-demo.gif)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lissy93/dashy/master/docs/assets/status-check-demo.gif)

> For full widget documentation, see: [**Widgets**](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/docs/widgets.md)

You can display dynamic content from services in the form of widgets. There are several pre-built widgets availible for showing useful info, and integrations with commonly self-hosted services, but you can also easily create your own for almost any app.

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6c7e8b827d8db7d5920b6ac66f2b5a8228fe75641e1263ef20a15572fab454ea/68747470733a2f2f692e6962622e636f2f47466a585648792f64617368792d776964676574732e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6c7e8b827d8db7d5920b6ac66f2b5a8228fe75641e1263ef20a15572fab454ea/68747470733a2f2f692e6962622e636f2f47466a585648792f64617368792d776964676574732e706e67)

## Authentication üîê

[](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#authentication-)

> For full authentication documentation, see: [**Authentication**](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/docs/authentication.md)

Dashy has full support for secure single-sign-on using [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) for secure, easy authentication, see [setup docs](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/docs/authentication.md#keycloak) for a full usage guide.

There is also a basic auth feature, which doesn't require additional setup. To enable this, add an `auth` attribute under `appConfig`, containing an array of `users`, each with a username, SHA-256 hashed password and optional user type. Basic auth also supports several access control features, including read-only guest access and granular controls.

```yaml
appConfig:
  auth:
    users:
    - user: alicia
      hash: 4D1E58C90B3B94BCAD9848ECCACD6D2A8C9FBC5CA913304BBA5CDEAB36FEEFA3

## Alternate Views üëì

[](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#alternate-views-)

As well as the default homepage, there is also:

- A minimal view, valid for use as a browser start page
- A workspace view, useful for visiting many apps simultaneously

You can change the view from the UI, using the switch icon in the top-right corner, or select a default view in the config under `appConfig.startingView` attribute.

**Example of Workspace View**

> For full documentation on views and opening methods, see: [**Alternate Views**](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/docs/alternate-views.md)

There are several different ways you can launch apps. You can specify the default opening method for any given item under the `target` attribute or set a site-wide default under `appConfig.defaultOpeningMethod`. Right-click on an item to item for all options. The following options are supported:

- `sametab` - The app will be launched in the current tab
- `newtab` - The app will be launched in a new tab (or use Ctrl + Click)
- `modal` - Launch app in a resizable/ movable popup modal on the current page (or use Alt + Click)
- `workspace` - Changes to Workspace view and launches app
- `clipboard` - Copy the app's URL to your system clipboard
- `top` - Opens in the top-most browsing context, useful if you're accessing Dashy through an iframe

## Searching and Shortcuts üîé

[](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#searching-and-shortcuts-)

> For full documentation on searching, see: [**Searching & Shortcuts**](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/docs/searching.md)

Quickly finding and launching applications is the primary aim of Dashy. To that end, instant search and customizable keyboard shortcuts are built-in.

To start filtering, start typing‚Äîno need to select the search bar or use any special key. Then use either the tab key or arrow keys to select and move between results, and hit enter to launch the currently selected application.

For apps that you use regularly, you can set a custom keybinding. Use the `hotkey` parameter on a certain item to specify a numeric key between `0 - 9`. You can then launch that app by just pressing that key.

You can also add custom tags to a given item to make finding them based on keywords easier. For example, in the following example, searching for 'Movies' will show 'Plex'

```yaml
  items:
  - title: Plex
    hotkey: 8
    icon: favicon
    description: Media library
    url: https://plex.lab.local
    tags: [ movies, videos, music ]
```

To search the web directly through Dashy, just press enter after typing your query. Options for web search are set under `appConfig.webSearch`. There is built-in support for [10+ search engines](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/docs/searching.md#setting-search-engine), or [use your own custom provider](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/docs/searching.md#using-custom-search-engine) or self-hosted instance. With the web search, you can also define your bangs to redirect results to any given app, website, or search engine, when the query is preceded with a certain character sequence (usually beginning in `/`, `!` or `:`).

```yaml
webSearch:
  searchEngine: duckduckgo
  openingMethod: newtab
  searchBangs:
    /r: reddit
    /w: wikipedia
    /s: https://whoogle.local/search?q=
    ':wolf': wolframalpha
    ':so': stackoverflow
    ':git': github
```

Hit `Esc` at any time to close any open apps, clear the search field, or hide any modals.

## Config Editor ‚öôÔ∏è

[](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#config-editor-Ô∏è)

> For full config documentation, see: [**Configuring**](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/docs/configuring.md)

As well as passing in a YAML config file, you can also configure the app directly through the UI and preview changes live.

To edit any section or item, right-click on it, and select "Edit", or enter the Edit Mode (using the Pen icon in the top-right), then click any part of the page to edit. Changes will be visible immediately but will not be saved until clicking "Save to Disk" or "Save Locally".

Under the config menu, you can export, view, backup, or reset app config and edit the raw config file in a text editor with built-in schema validation. It's recommended to keep a backup of your config.

## Cloud Backup & Sync ‚òÅ

[](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#cloud-backup--sync-)

> For full backup documentation, see: [**Cloud Backup & Sync**](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/docs/backup-restore.md)

Dashy has an **optional** built-in feature for securely backing up your config to a hosted cloud service and then restoring it on another instance. This is useful not only for backing up your configuration off-site but also enables Dashy to be used without having to write a YAML config file.

All data is fully E2E encrypted before being sent to the backend (done in [`CloudBackup.js`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/src/utils/CloudBackup.js) using [crypto.js](https://github.com/brix/crypto-js) 's AES method). The data is then sent to a [Cloudflare worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/learning/how-workers-works) and stored in a [KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/learning/how-kv-works) data store.

## Language Switching üåé

[](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#language-switching-)

> For full internationalization documentation, see: [**Multi-Language Support**](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/docs/multi-language-support.md)

Dashy supports multiple languages and locales. When available, your language should be automatically detected and applied on load. But you can also select a language through the UI (under config --> Switch Language) or set `appConfig.language` to your language (specified as a 2-digit [ISO 639-1 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)), as seen below, e.g. `language: de`.

#### Add your Language

[](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#add-your-language)

I would love Dashy to be available to everyone without language being a barrier to entry. If you've got a few minutes to spare, consider adding translations for your language. It's a quick task, and all text is in [a single JSON file](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/tree/master/src/assets/locales). Since any missing text will fall back to English, you don't need to translate it all.

## Multi-Page Support üìÉ

[](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#multi-page-support-)

> For full multi-page documentation, see: [**Pages & Sections**](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/docs/pages-and-sections.md)

Within your dashboard, you can have as many sub-pages as you require. To load additional pages, specify a name, and path to a config file under `pages`. The config file can be either local (stored in `/public`), or remote (located anywhere accessible).

```yaml
pages:
- name: Networking Services
  path: 'networking.yml'
- name: Work Stuff
  path: 'work.yml'
```

Or

```yaml
pages:
- name: Getting Started
  path: 'https://snippet.host/tvcw/raw'
- name: Homelab
  path: 'https://snippet.host/tetp/raw'
- name: Browser Startpage
  path: 'https://snippet.host/zcom/raw'
```

## System Requirements üìä

[](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#system-requirements-)

If running on bare metal, Dashy requires [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) V 16.0.0 or later, LTS (16.13.2) is recommended.

If running in Docker container, the recommended base image is Alpine (3.15)

The hardware requirements vary depending on where and how you are running Dashy. Generally speaking, on a bare-metal system or Docker container, 1GB of memory should be more than enough, and depending on whether you are using your own assets, then 1GB of disk space should be sufficient.

If you are using one of the 1-click cloud deployment methods, serving the app through a CDN or using a static hosting provider, then there are no specific requirements, as the built app is just a series of static JS files, and so is very light-weight.

Dashy also wells run on low-powered ARM-based single board computers, such as a Raspberry Pi (tested on Pi 3)
